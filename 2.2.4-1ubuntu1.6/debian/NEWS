gnupg2 (2.2.4-1ubuntu1.1) bionic-security; urgency=medium

  gpg: The MDC encryption mode is now always used regardless of the
  cipher algorithm or any preferences.  For testing --rfc2440 can
  be used to create a message without an MDC.

  gpg: Decryption of messages not using the MDC mode will now lead
  to a hard failure even if a legacy cipher algorithm was used.
  The option --ignore-mdc-error can be used to turn this failure into a
  warning.  Take care: Never use that option unconditionally or
  without a prior warning.
