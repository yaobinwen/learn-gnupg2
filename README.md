# Learn GnuPG2

## Overview

This repository contains the versions of [gnupg2](https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg2) source files that I'm interested in and the notes I made for learning purpose. Because I mainly work on Ubuntu, the source code all comes from the `gnupg2` package on Launchpad. Therefore, the code in this repository belongs to the original authors and should be used under the same license. See [their license files (`COPYING` and `COPYING.*`) on Launchpad](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnupg2/tree/).

Each version is in its own sub-folder. My notes are all marked with `NOTE(ywen)`. The log messages I added are prefixed with `[ywen]`.
